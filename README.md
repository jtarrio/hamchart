This is a program to build azimuthal equidistant maps for Ham radio (amateur radio) operators.

Azimuthal equidistant maps show the direction and distance to any point on Earth from a predetermined location.

Ham radio operators use radio transmitters and receivers to contact each other. Some radio bands allow for very long distance contacts -- often, thousands of miles -- and some operators use highly directional antennas. With an azimuthal equidistant map, those operators can quickly determine the direction they should point their antenna.

Even for those operators who don't use directional antennas, an azimuthal equidistant map is useful as it shows the distance to any point on Earth from the operator's location, and lets them know if they are likely to be able to contact a distant location or, by plotting all contacts, figure out the antenna's radiation pattern.

This was my first program written in Go, so its quality is not great. I decided to upload it all the same in case it is useful to someone.
